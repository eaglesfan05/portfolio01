            <p>Growing up I was always told how smart I was. I made the honor roll every quarter until 7th grade.
                I also always got the best results in the areas I was the most physical.
                My father was a brick mason and I started working with him when I was about 11 years old.
                Doing that I helped build houses, sidewalks, fireplaces, patios etc.
                I had to be strong carrying equipment and supplies.
                About the same time I started playing football and I was a linemen.
                Offense. Defense. Special teams. I played it all. 
                I just wanted contact. I was a team captain my whole highschool career. Defensive MVP. Second team WCAC for offensive line.
                I was also that football player who did whatever I wanted and mostly that was cuttin up.
                Not surprisingly that translated to a coach that didn't like me and didn't tell me I was too short to play the position I had mastered at the next level.
            </p>

            <p>This class has given me a chance to realize what I can do with my mind.
                It is definitely challenging. But it is rewarding when you get something right and see the results.
                I'm excited to see the possibilities that come from learning web developement. For me I'm excited about the prospect to always be learning.
